### Our Story Section
- "YADA" is a Hebrew word that means to know — not just surface-level or head knowledge, but a deep, personal, soul-level understanding of who you truly are.
- Yada Experience was born from a simple but powerful realization: too many young people are navigating life without a clear sense of identity or direction.
- We exist to bridge that gap — creating transformative spaces where young people can pause, reflect, and reconnect with who they are and why they're here.
